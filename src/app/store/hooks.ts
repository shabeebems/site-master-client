// Redux provides useDispatch and useSelector, but they are not type-safe in TypeScript by default. Thatâ€™s why we define custom hooks.

import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from "./store";

// Typed hooks
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
